### About Me
I am a **Cloud Infrastructure Engineer** focused on AWS and Platform Engineering.

I build secure, automated infrastructure using **First Principles**. I combine **Infrastructure as Code** with **FinOps** strategies to engineer systems that are efficient by design. My goal is to master the craft of building production-grade platforms without unnecessary complexity or cost.

Currently executing a portfolio of infrastructure projects to demonstrate core engineering patterns.

### What I Build
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Baking security into AMIs with Packer & Ansible.
*   **Resilient Networks:** Architecting Multi-AZ VPCs without costly NAT Gateways.
*   **Observability:** Full-stack monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana.
*   **Automation:** Self-hosted CI/CD runners and "Ops-in-a-Box" solutions.
